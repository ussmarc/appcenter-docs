Adding a New OS Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every appliance must have an OS profile, which contains all the operating system packages for the appliance.  UForge allows you to easily create an OS profile from a set of standard profiles. You can then add specific operating system packages.  

The goal is to only include the operating system packages you require to run your application.  This process is known as JeOS (Just Enough Operating System). By only using the operating system packages you need, not only do you reduce the footprint of the resulting machine image, you also make the machine image easier to maintain (as there are less updates) and (hypothetically) more secure as there will be less unwanted services started.

To add an OS profile to your appliance: 

	1. Double click on the appliance you want to edit.
	2. Go to the ``Stack`` page.
	3. Click on ``OS Profile`` in the toolbox.
	4. From the drop-down menu, select the ``OS profile`` template you wish to use. The operating system packages are added automatically and your appliance revision number is increased.

Adding Packages to the OS Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may want to add packages that are provided as part of the operating system distribution. To get a list of all the packages that correspond to your search criteria:
	
	1. Select the appliance to modify and go to the ``Stack`` page.
	2. Click on ``OS Profile`` in the toolbox.
	3. Enter your search string. For example, add ``php`` as a search string to get a list of all the PHP packages provided by CentOS. 
	4. Click the search icon.

	5. Optionally you can filter the results by checking ``Show only 32-bit packages`` (which appears once you have typed something in the search box and pressed Enter) or by entering text in the ``filter`` box.
	6. Select the packages you want to add.
	7. Click the ``save`` button to add the packages to the OS profile.

.. note:: When you create an appliance, the packages are stored locally in the UForge cache repository. This ensures that the packages will always be available. However, UForge tracks all available updates. 

For more information on package updates, see :ref:`appliance-pkg-updates`. If you want to make sure you always have a specific version of a package, read :ref:`appliance-pkg-updates-sticky`.
